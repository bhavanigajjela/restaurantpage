                In economics, a recession is a business cycle contraction that occurs when there is a general decline in economic activity.Recessions generally occur when there is a widespread drop in spending (an adverse demand shock). This may be triggered by various events, such as a financial
                crisis, an external trade shock, an adverse supply shock, the bursting of an economic bubble, or a large-scale anthropogenic or natural disaster (e.g. a pandemic).

                Like national recessions, a consensus on the definition of a global recession has yet to be reached. The World Bank’s main indicator of a worldwide downturn is <a href="https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/185391583249079464/pdf/Global-Recessions.pdf">multiple major countries’ economies contracting at the same time</a>, as well as other evidence of weak global economic growth.
